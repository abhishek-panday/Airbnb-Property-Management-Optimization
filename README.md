# Airbnb Property Management Optimization

## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing **Airbnb property management** using **Tableau dashboards** and data analysis. The goal is to provide insights into **pricing strategies, property demand, seasonal trends, and guest preferences** to help property owners maximize revenue and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
As a **Data Analyst at Airbnb**, my role was to analyze the dataset to:
- Identify **high-demand locations** and **pricing trends**
- Determine **factors influencing guest satisfaction**
- Optimize **rental strategies based on seasonal trends**
- Enhance **decision-making for Airbnb and its hosts**

## Key Insights
### 1. **Property Density & Pricing Trends**
- **Manhattan & Brooklyn** have the highest property concentration.
- **Manhattan** has the highest property prices, followed by **Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island**.
- High property prices in **Manhattan** indicate a **high standard of living** in the area.

### 2. **Correlation Analysis**
- **Property Price vs. Reviews (-0.0046):** No significant impact of price on guest reviews.
- **Service Fees vs. Reviews (-0.0044):** Service fees do not affect guest satisfaction.
- **Construction Year vs. Property Price (-0.0036):** Property age does not influence pricing.

### 3. **Room Type Preferences**
- **Hotel rooms in Brooklyn & Queens** have the highest average reviews (3.75), showing better guest experience.
- **Shared rooms in Queens & Staten Island** are rated well due to affordability.
- **Hotel rooms in Manhattan** are preferred due to their **lower average price**.

### 4. **Host Listings & Visits**

- **Brooklyn** has a **high total property value ($2.6M)** but significantly fewer listings (**107K**).
- **Entire homes/apartments & private rooms** have the highest visits (**53K & 46K** respectively).

### 5. **Average Length of Stay**

- **Hotels:** **4.2 days (short-term stays, highest rating & value for money)**
- **Private & shared rooms:** **6.3 & 6.6 days (moderate stays)**

### 6. **Business Trend Analysis**

- **Winter months show a decline**, except **December & January** (Christmas & New Year boost).

## Conclusion
- **Manhattan & Brooklyn** dominate the Airbnb market with the highest **listings & demand**.
